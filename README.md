LSTM Next 3 Word Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on building a Next Three Word Prediction model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a popular architecture of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). The aim of the model is to predict the next three words in a given sequence of text, making it useful for text generation and autocomplete systems. By leveraging large textual datasets, the model can capture the context and semantics of the input text, enabling accurate predictions of the next sequence of words.

Features
Text Sequence Prediction: Predicts the next three words based on the input text sequence.
LSTM Architecture: Uses LSTM neural networks to model temporal dependencies in text, making it more effective in understanding word sequences.
Data Preprocessing & Tokenization: Text data is cleaned, tokenized, and padded to ensure consistency for model training.
Hyperparameter Tuning: The model's performance is optimized through tuning key hyperparameters like learning rate, number of LSTM units, batch size, and epochs.
High Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy and reliable predictions by training on large datasets and tuning parameters effectively.
Dataset
The model is trained on a large text corpus, such as news articles, books, or custom datasets, which are preprocessed before being fed into the model. The preprocessing steps include:

Text Cleaning: Removal of special characters, punctuation, and stop words.
Tokenization: Converting words into numerical tokens for model input.
Sequence Padding: Ensuring that all input sequences are of the same length for batch training.
Model Architecture
The model architecture is based on LSTM layers, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks due to their ability to retain information over longer time steps. The architecture involves:

Embedding Layer: Converts input tokens into dense vectors of fixed size.
LSTM Layer: Captures sequential dependencies and context in the input text.
Dense Layers: Fully connected layers for final predictions.
Softmax Activation: Outputs the probability distribution over the next three words.
